				<p class="abstract"> Opinion piece - Extension of Cultural Studies Taken
				</p>
				
				<p class="abstract"> Context - My position as an executive member of an Anime society makes and exposes me
				to many situations where I have had to confront the difficulties between students, society and this interest/hobby.
				Many times, I have had to cross cultural boundaries to carry out events which has led to difficult situations.
				To this end; I accept this hobby as a niche, and hope to provide a safe and comfortable environment for people 
				who enjoy this hobby to express themselves as such without prejudice or disdain. This piece was more an follow-up
				on community cultures that I have experienced an my means of writing such thoughts academically.
				</p>
				
				<p></p>
				
				<p>The foundation of eastern and western culture has always seen conflict in many facets of its 
				society. From Culture to television, the cultural divisions between the "east" and the west" have 
				existed since these cultures first met in history. Anime has often been a subject of discrimination 
				within western social cultures as a result of this dichotomy, which has led to the generalisation of 
				the genre and a social devaluation of its merit within society.
				</p>
				
				<p>Anime by tradition has had mixed audiences. It caters to both children and mature adults in its 
				theme. It can be serious as much as it can be light-hearted, ranging for school-life to future 
				world dystopia. However, with such a spectrum of material for substantial audience, anime has often suffered from the 
				"bad first impression/impact" thus leading some audiences to generalise the entire industry and 
				dismiss it from mind. I find this aspect disappointing as I don't make it a habit to judge a 
				media industry from that one movie I watched that one time and didn't like. For why should 
				anime be subject to such treatment, when Hollywood still thrives. The answer returns to the 
				dichotomy of east and west, and how "foreign" media is placed second to "mainstream" media. 	
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Judging a book by its cover, anime has distinctive features that distinguish it from mainstream 
				media, making it both recognisable and simultaneously target-able.
				</p>
				
				<p>"It's just cartoons", "It's all fan service", "It's a fighter flick", "It's a children's show"
				</p>
				
				<p>These comments are not new, yet they are constantly applied to anime when the same comments can 
				often be applied right back to their preferred media. Movie makers strive to apply sexual appeal 
				within their movies, in tandem with what audiences will enjoy because that is what will sell. 
				And thus when anime attempts to do the same it is shunned (albeit, the audience of anime is 
				grounded in Japan and thus distanced from audiences abroad).
				</p>
				
				<p>With such stereotypes applied to anime, the generalisation has naturally permeated to 
				contaminate the image of its(read;anime') audiences, with derogatory terms such as "weeaboos" and 
				"otakus", derived from the Japanese language and given express and implied negative connations. 
				So much so that holding open conversation regarding anime can lead to overt generalisation of a 
				person's character. Morally, I feel that people that place weight in the very fact that someone 
				watches anime to be rather shallow in character, that they were to judge a person by their interests;
				it undoubtedly impact a persons perceptions of another to a greater degree than if they were to watch 
				more accepted forms of media.
				</p>

				<p>The generalisation and use of Japanese terms is both ironic and disappointing. The term 
				"weeaboo" arose from internet culture as a generalisation for people that obsessed in Japanese 
				culture, and has since spread to encompass those that interact with Japanese culture in 
				general. Hence thanks to the internet the term propagated. "otaku" had a similar appropriation 
				from the Japanese language, which is a term for people with keen interests in anime and 
				manga, and has since been spread and used as a term to potentially describe even the lightest of 
				anime watchers. 
				</p>
				
				<p>I understand that my description of the use of these terms covers the most extreme usages of 
				them, however, it is this extreme usage nevertheless that make it a staple generalisation of anime. It 
				is often the vocal/active minority that influences the aspects and perceptions of the passive 
				wider audience. Those that hold no strong opinions on anime are often swayed by comments and 
				opinions of their peers, and while there are millions of anime watchers and enthusiast world-
				wide, the mainstream audience, and its overlap easily outnumber them by factors over 100. 
				It makes the wide majority question themselves; and in a time where the self is moulded not 
				solely by the person but with society's pressures as well.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I understand that it should be natural that Anime is placed second to mainstream content 
				outside of its place of origin in Japan where culture and society has been built about the 
				industry, rather than its immigration into other countries. It would be strange if it wasn't.
				But while cultures have its niche; the mainstream can seemingly seek to dominate such niche's
				through ostracization, stigmatization and otherwise. And audiences invariably follow.
