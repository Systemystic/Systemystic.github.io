				</p>
				
				<p> Australian Gaming has been an extensively growing industry for some time now, but his cultural shift has not been
				spontaneous, rather a collection of influences and social shifts that have engendered an perceived industry boom.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Entertainment is one of the biggest drivers of consumer spending in first world countries. Whether that involves 
				live entertainment to video games is of little consequence to the overall growth in this form of spending, 
				but while such an industry is so successful; Australia suffers from a peculiar quirk in circumstances that 
				has in one way impacted our consumption of entertainment culture; but simultaneously turn to enhance it.
				</p>
				
				<p> 
				These circumstances in isolation are seen lightly; but taken and compounded has the ability to influence consumption 
				on a national level. These circumstances are;
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li> Locale </li>
					<li> National Culture </li>
					<li> Domestic Infrastructure </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
				One aspect immediately obvious in terms of consumption media; is our overabundance of it from a myriad of sources. 
				As a “western” country; Australia is in the unique position to be among “eastern” cultures; which often meant delayed 
				content and the need to develop our own; taking from a myriad of available closer sources. This point was evident long 
				before the advent of the internet due to our international geography and as a result has been a major influence on 
				Australia Culture. This aspect has carried well past the point where information became all accessible and pervaded 
				into a period where it seems irrelevant and obsolete.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The lack of same day release of western media; which not until recently was often weeks or months delayed from their 
				premier in American and European countries and their Australian counterparts. An aspect that is especially prevalent
				in entertainment and video games
				</p>
				
				<p>
				 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/australia-culture-blog/2013/oct/02/breaking-bad-finale-television-downloads"
				 >For example the recent popularity of “Breaking Bad”</a> which was a full four and a half hours delayed from its airing 
				 on American televisions to reach Australia (albeit at exorbitant pricing). This example of delay should have been 
				 eradicated with the capabilities of the internet; but persists to the frustration of Australian content consumers. 
				 And while 4 and a half hours may seem inconsequential to many; thanks to the hyper stream of information that is the 
				 internet; much content is superseded, which has led to the unfortunate side effect of ruining the enjoyment of 
				 content or having to avoid popular media to maintain said enjoyment.
				</p>
				
				<p> To the gaming audience; this had been a standing issue; which has been significantly addressed by the rise of 
				cross-region development. And while release dates do occasionally differ; platforms such as Steam and GOG aim to 
				bring these releases as close as possible; an aspect which Australian's have hugely benefited from.

				<p class="abstract"> Academic Writing - An Analysis of Creativity 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Creativity has often been seen as an ambiguous concept being constantly defined and redefined by 
				scholars and philosophers throughout history. Its study began with the academic address made by 
				J.P Guildford (1950), qualitatively defining creativity into strict and measurable constructs 
				for research; fluency, flexibility, novelty, synthesis, analysis, reorganisation, redefinition, 
				complexity and elaboration. Traditionally, creativity was seen as a significant, individual trait,
				and research focused solely on exploring their individuality; their cognitive processes, their 
				creative personality, their behavioural elements and their broad environmental contexts and 
				influences (Amabile & Kurtzberg 2001). Several theories broadened this view such as Amabile’s 
				1983 Intrinsic Motivation Hypothesis of Creativity suggesting the contributions to creativity; 
				that the intrinsically motivated state (such as interest and enjoyment), the extrinsically 
				motivated states (environment, reward) have significant impact to creativity. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Many theories profess the impact of the “surrounding environment”, leading to new ethnological 
				research into the concept of “distributed creativity”; the collaboration of individuals generates 
				a shared creative product. Rather than a reliance on the individual, cognitive processes when 
				distributed across collaborating individuals have also shown visible signs of creativity (Sawyer 
				& DeZutter 2009). These creative products can have predictable to unpredictable outcomes; allowing 
				for creative freedom as well and ingenuity in the production process. Saywer (2003) terms these group 
				processes and creative improvisations as “collaborative emergence” describing improvised methods, 
				forms or codes produced over time spontaneously. As such, this concept has been applied in numerous 
				contexts for innovative problem solving and application to goals, as observed by Sawyer & DeZutter 
				in their study (2009) on distributed creativity. As Sawyer & DeZutter’s theory is heavily grounded 
				in personal interaction, and thus its influence, especially in terms of conflict and co-operation 
				can potentially determine the fate of such groups. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In groups, new barriers are present; specifically through conflict borne of interaction. Conflict 
				in this case is described as “the consequence of perceived incompatibilities among individuals” 
				(Boulding 1962 in Badke-Schaub et.al, 2010) and seen as a volatile and destructive condition 
				(Kurtzberg and Amabile 2001). Conflict within groups is often unavoidable due to the presence and 
				differences in views, interests, goals and values that individuals have (Dadke-Schaub et.al 2010). 
				Tsosvold (1991) categorises conflict into 3 major distinctions of varying degrees;  
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li> Cognitive conflict – seen as disagreement and clash in points of view. Tsosvold (1991) describes this conflict as “differences in task related issues” and often the most beneficial conflict.</li>
					<li> Affective Conflict – seen as personal issues, negative emotions and dislike. </li>
					<li> Process Conflict – seen as difference in approaches to problems. </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
				Any outcomes of these conflicts will impact the creative potential of the group, either through 
				motivating and encouraging innovation through productive discourse, or hindering it, through team 
				imposed and implied restrictions such as dislike, fear of criticism and loafing. The team composition 
				is thus vital in creating a productive group, taking into account sufficient diversity, freedom, and 
				resources to encourage creativity and innovation, while avoiding destructive group differences (Kurtzberg 
				and Amabile 2001). Often this is an expensive process when compared with individual creativity, which 
				trades away wider innovation in return for little to no conflict. As such, creative and innovative products 
				are markedly linked and influenced by the processes contributed to create them (Amabile et.al 1996 in 
				Badke-Schaub et.al 2010). As technology progresses, cognitive processes grow thanks to greater information 
				access and thusly creative and innovative approaches grow accordingly. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The advent of social media has blurred the boundaries between the personal and professional within the 
				news industry (Rogstad 2014). The position as gatekeeper of mass communication (Paulussen & Harder 2014) 
				that the news and broadcast businesses had traditionally monopolised had finally been circumvented by 
				social media. As a result, the journalistic ecosystem shifted dramatically from one-way “press agentry” 
				and “public information” to methods which collaborated between the writer and the reader, bridging and 
				closing the gap between professionals and amateurs (Bastos 2015). This greater connection between the 
				readership and the journalist brought to light the issue surrounding social media conduct, specifically 
				journalistic professionalism and personal commentary thanks to the difference in expectations of content 
				on social media platforms. Journalists as such became aware of this dichotomy and made attempted to 
				maintain professional standards online (Rogstad 2014), while also supporting and furthering their own 
				relationships with their peers and their readership (Paulussen & Harder 2014). Overall this served in 
				adapting the news industry to a new media platform, catering for a new demographic of users, thanks to 
				the fragmentation and individualisation of the tradition news industry and audience. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				With the ownership of the news is no longer monopolised in the hands of journalists, discussion and discourse 
				online paved the way for user interaction and user generated content (Heinrich 2012 in Paulussen & Harder 2014).
				Thanks to social media, the internet allowed for the mass germination of ideas and innovative practices and 
				platforms that supplemented news and information propagation, relieving responsibility from the journalist. 
				Active recipients could take active roles in promoting and adding to content via discourse and providing 
				diverse interpretations and discussions on news topics in a process similar to distributed creativity. 
				However, with such discourse, conflict will inevitably arise, especially with the extreme diversity that 
				the internet is able to facilitate. With no restricting and resolving forces, conflicts will often escalate 
				rapidly. Only the anonymity offered through the internet has prevented conflict from having real world
				implications, a trait that was seen in Kurtzberg and Amabile’ study (2001) that allowed for extreme 
				conflict to remain appropriate in degrees where normal groups would have already broken down. 
				In this way, the internet allowed for people to say their piece without fear of repercussions, 
				allowing for broad and extreme idea generation and discourse. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Creativity was once seen as a personal human trait and has since been constantly reinterpreted as societies 
				changed and evolved. A shift away from the individual allowed for the distribution of creativity among 
				interested parties. However this was not infallible, as conflicts arise naturally and constantly, but while 
				destructive, conflict had potential to encourage creativity. This process of team based creativity has accelerated 
				with the advent of the internet and social media, allowing for interaction and collaboration on scales never seen before.

				<p class="abstract"> Opinion piece - Extension of Cultural Studies Taken
				</p>
				
				<p class="abstract"> Context - My position as an executive member of an Anime society makes and exposes me
				to many situations where I have had to confront the difficulties between students, society and this interest/hobby.
				Many times, I have had to cross cultural boundaries to carry out events which has led to difficult situations.
				To this end; I accept this hobby as a niche, and hope to provide a safe and comfortable environment for people 
				who enjoy this hobby to express themselves as such without prejudice or disdain. This piece was more an follow-up
				on community cultures that I have experienced an my means of writing such thoughts academically.
				</p>
				
				<p></p>
				
				<p>The foundation of eastern and western culture has always seen conflict in many facets of its 
				society. From Culture to television, the cultural divisions between the "east" and the west" have 
				existed since these cultures first met in history. Anime has often been a subject of discrimination 
				within western social cultures as a result of this dichotomy, which has led to the generalisation of 
				the genre and a social devaluation of its merit within society.
				</p>
				
				<p>Anime by tradition has had mixed audiences. It caters to both children and mature adults in its 
				theme. It can be serious as much as it can be light-hearted, ranging for school-life to future 
				world dystopia. However, with such a spectrum of material for substantial audience, anime has often suffered from the 
				"bad first impression/impact" thus leading some audiences to generalise the entire industry and 
				dismiss it from mind. I find this aspect disappointing as I don't make it a habit to judge a 
				media industry from that one movie I watched that one time and didn't like. For why should 
				anime be subject to such treatment, when Hollywood still thrives. The answer returns to the 
				dichotomy of east and west, and how "foreign" media is placed second to "mainstream" media. 	
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Judging a book by its cover, anime has distinctive features that distinguish it from mainstream 
				media, making it both recognisable and simultaneously target-able.
				</p>
				
				<p>"It's just cartoons", "It's all fan service", "It's a fighter flick", "It's a children's show"
				</p>
				
				<p>These comments are not new, yet they are constantly applied to anime when the same comments can 
				often be applied right back to their preferred media. Movie makers strive to apply sexual appeal 
				within their movies, in tandem with what audiences will enjoy because that is what will sell. 
				And thus when anime attempts to do the same it is shunned (albeit, the audience of anime is 
				grounded in Japan and thus distanced from audiences abroad).
				</p>
				
				<p>With such stereotypes applied to anime, the generalisation has naturally permeated to 
				contaminate the image of its(read;anime') audiences, with derogatory terms such as "weeaboos" and 
				"otakus", derived from the Japanese language and given express and implied negative connations. 
				So much so that holding open conversation regarding anime can lead to overt generalisation of a 
				person's character. Morally, I feel that people that place weight in the very fact that someone 
				watches anime to be rather shallow in character, that they were to judge a person by their interests;
				it undoubtedly impact a persons perceptions of another to a greater degree than if they were to watch 
				more accepted forms of media.
				</p>

				<p>The generalisation and use of Japanese terms is both ironic and disappointing. The term 
				"weeaboo" arose from internet culture as a generalisation for people that obsessed in Japanese 
				culture, and has since spread to encompass those that interact with Japanese culture in 
				general. Hence thanks to the internet the term propagated. "otaku" had a similar appropriation 
				from the Japanese language, which is a term for people with keen interests in anime and 
				manga, and has since been spread and used as a term to potentially describe even the lightest of 
				anime watchers. 
				</p>
				
				<p>I understand that my description of the use of these terms covers the most extreme usages of 
				them, however, it is this extreme usage nevertheless that make it a staple generalisation of anime. It 
				is often the vocal/active minority that influences the aspects and perceptions of the passive 
				wider audience. Those that hold no strong opinions on anime are often swayed by comments and 
				opinions of their peers, and while there are millions of anime watchers and enthusiast world-
				wide, the mainstream audience, and its overlap easily outnumber them by factors over 100. 
				It makes the wide majority question themselves; and in a time where the self is moulded not 
				solely by the person but with society's pressures as well.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				I understand that it should be natural that Anime is placed second to mainstream content 
				outside of its place of origin in Japan where culture and society has been built about the 
				industry, rather than its immigration into other countries. It would be strange if it wasn't.
				But while cultures have its niche; the mainstream can seemingly seek to dominate such niche's
				through ostracization, stigmatization and otherwise. And audiences invariably follow.
