						<h2> Game and Gamer </h2>
						
						<p>
							<h4> Who am I? </h4> 	A gamer; I run by "Systemtwo" in the games I play.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I play a variety of games; from different genres, from first person shooter/FPS to real time strategies/RTS. 
							Often in the games I play I develop an interest into the inner intricacies of the game; whether they be the decisions behind the
							design choices as they are perceived by players,and how they were intended by designers or deeper meanings and lessons 
							that are embedded deeper within the mechanics of the games. Outside of the game; I follow games and their communities closely, 
							wanting to further understand the player interaction, public perception and above all the developer response in kind.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I have been known to get very involved in online communities; often rising to organisational or moderation 
							roles within the community. Often I gain these positions by making myself known within the respective communities
							where I have met some amazing people from across the world who share this interest in video games. 
							Meeting fellow players and interacting both online and offline has become to me the foundation of many 
							lasting friendships; highlighting what I believe as one of the most prevalent social networks on the internet;
							even more so than Facebook. Community structures that form spontaneously; such as through reddit, or organisationally; 
							through in-game means will always be a driving factor behind player motivations of enjoyment and game engagement.
							Because no-one like to play games on their own.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Within games I have often held leadership positions in guilds; organising public events and general maintenance of these communities
							Outside of games; I have often officiated and played group games; particularly Dungeons and Dragons, where I have led the story as the
							Dungeon Master.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I have a self-made blog that I will periodically use to ramble, analyse and/or explore about a variety of topics
							that interest me. If you are so interested in reading my walls of text; Please visit my blog; aptly named <a href="ip.html" >The IP ; Intellectual Property".</a>

						<h2> Work and Community </h2>
						
						<p>
							Through playing games; I have been able to involve myself with organisations and Communities; creating events and managing communications.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							" <a href="http://planetsidebattles.org/" >Planetside Battles</a> "; A Third Party affiliate of Daybreak Games 
							(formerly Sony Online Entertainment) involved in their FPS MMO Planetside 2. Planetside 2 is and Open-world 
							MMO FPS based on "continents' that span equivalents to 8km by 8km across 3 warring factions. My role in PlanetSide Battles 
							is as a Server Representative for the Briggs (AU) server. This was an elected role; voted on by the 'outfits' of the server,
							commonly guilds in other MMOs. My responsibilities involve the communication of public server opinion, and the 
							organisation of community and tournament events. These events are typically called "Serversmashes". These events consist 
							of the creation of server teams of players up to 244 players, and the creation of a command structure
							These teams would then be pitted against each other on tournament servers; with requisite accounts; 
							organised by Server Representatives. 
						</p>

							within the university and without with parties such as sponsors and relevant businesses.

						<p>
							<span class="boldemoverride"> Community Management </span>; Throughout University and into Video Games, I have always been active and as such have often 
							led to management and community roles; either designated by current administrators
							or voted on by the majority of the community.

							<span class="boldemoverride"> Exhibition and Conventions </span>; My leadership positions in University and online with game communities has had me participate at
