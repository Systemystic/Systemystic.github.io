						<h2> Game and Gamer </h2>
						
						<p>
							<h4> Who am I? </h4> 	A gamer; I run by "Systemtwo" typically in the games I play.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I play a variety of games; different genres, from first person shooters to real time strategies. I am often very invested into the games I play; wanting to understand design choices as they are perceived by players,
							and how they were intended by designers. Outside of the game; I follow games and their communities closely, wanting to understand the player interaction, public perception and above all the developer response in kind.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I have been known to get very involved in online communities; often rising to organisational or moderation roles within the community. Often I gain these positions by making myself known within the respective communities
							where I have met some amazing people from across the world who share this interest in video games. Meeting fellow players and interacting both online and offline has become to me the foundation of many lasting friendships
							; highlighting what I believe as one of the most prevalent social networks on the internet; even more so than Facebook. Community structures that form spontaneously; such as through reddit, or organisationally; 
							through in-game means will always be a driving factor behind player motivations. Because no-one like to play games on their own.
						</p>

						<h2> Work and Community </h2>
						
						<p>
							Through playing games; I have been able to involve myself with organisations and Communities; creating events and managing communications.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							" <a href="http://planetsidebattles.org/" >Planetside Battles</a> "; A Third Party affiliate of Daybreak Games (formerly Sony Online Entertainment) involved in thier FPS MMO Planetside 2. Planetside 2 is and Open-world MMO FPS based on "continents' that span
							equivalents to 8km by 8km across 3 warring factions.My role in PlanetSide Battles is as a Server Representative
							for the Briggs (AU) server. This was an elected role; voted on by the 'outfits' of the server, commonly guilds in other MMOs. My responsibilities involve the communication of public server opinion, and the 
							organisation of community and tournament events. These events are typically called "Serversmashes". These events consist of the creation of server teams of players up to 244 players, and the creation of a command structure
							These teams would then be pitted against each other on tournament servers; with requisite accounts; organised by Server Representatives. 
							
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Community Management; Throughout University and into Video Games, I have always been active and as such have often led to management and community roles; either designated by current administrators
							or voted on by the majority of the community. This has also led me to partake in management roles for events such as Exhibitions and Conventions and far-reaching collaborations with other organisations.
